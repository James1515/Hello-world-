# Hello-world

Hi Everyone,
My name is James, I am a programmer hobbyist, and a Computer Science major at Florida State University. 
I know English, and Spanish very well. Also, Java, C and C++ and I am always trying 
to know more than what I know now. Computer Science is a really interesting subject for 
me, and I have been programming since my early teens. 

Basically, aside from that, I am a Freethinker, a sapiosexual, and someone who likes to discuss 
science, history, and politics most of the time. I like music, basically all kinds, traveling, 
and knowing new people. So yeah! Basically me in a nutshell. :-)
